h3. Tip: Escape identification by style-analysis

- Write short sentences.
- Copy the style of others. Even if it is different from the tips here.
- Avoid special words (like "sophisticated" or "de-anonymization"). Except if all others use them, too.
- Have an "official" site in Freenet / Hyphanet, separate from your pseudonymous sites. There you can talk about daily life. That content would always link your pseudonymous sites to you. Do not adhere to these style rules there.
